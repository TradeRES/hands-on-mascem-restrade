# Hands-on MASCEM-RESTrade simulation of market bundles

## TradeRES Iberian Stakeholders’ Workshop:<br/>Electricity markets with high shares of renewables<br/><br/>Requested Preparations
To avoid waiting times for downloads and installation processes during the workshop, we ask
all participants to check if their system meets these requirements. Both, MASCEM and
RESTrade require the [Spine-Toolbox] for the version shown in this tutorial. The [Spine-Toolbox]
is an open-source Python package that can be downloaded from its [website].

## Check Python
You can test if you have Python available by using the command python --version. This should
show your Python version if the Python command is found. Note that if you use a Python
environment manager you can have several Python versions on your system side by side. If you
do not have Python installed on your system, you may use e.g., conda or mamba. We will use a
Python 3.9 installation for this tutorial.

## MASCEM
In this tutorial, we will use MASCEM integrated within the [Spine-Toolbox], not being necessary
to install anything else.

## RESTrade
RESTrade also requires Java JDK 11 or above. It operates on Linux, Mac, and Windows. In this
tutorial, we will use RESTrade integrated within the [Spine-Toolbox].

## Check Java
You can test if you have Java available by using the command java –-version (or java –version
on some systems). This should show your Java version if the Java command is found. If you get
a command not found error, or if the Java version is less than 11, please download and install a
recent JDK from, e.g., [here].
